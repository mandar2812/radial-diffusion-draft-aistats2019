abstract="Meshfree methods based on radial basis function (RBF) approximation are of interest for numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) because they are flexible with respect to geometry, they can provide high order convergence, they allow for local refinement, and they are easy to implement in higher dimensions. For global RBF methods, one of the major disadvantages is the computational cost associated with the dense linear systems that arise. Therefore, research is currently directed towards localized RBF approximations such as the RBF partition of unity collocation method (RBF--PUM) proposed here. The objective of this paper is to establish that RBF--PUM is viable for parabolic PDEs of convection--diffusion type. The stability and accuracy of RBF--PUM is investigated partly theoretically and partly numerically. Numerical experiments show that high-order algebraic convergence can be achieved for convection--diffusion problems. Numerical comparisons with finite difference and pseudospectral methods have been performed, showing that RBF--PUM is competitive with respect to accuracy, and in some cases also with respect to computational time. As an application, RBF--PUM is employed for a two-dimensional American option pricing problem. It is shown that using a node layout that captures the solution features improves the accuracy significantly compared with a uniform node distribution.",

In order to be competitive for very large scale simulations, the RBF–FD methods needs to be efficiently implemented for modern multicore based computer architectures. This is a challenging assignment, because the main computational operations are unstructured sparse matrix–vector multiplications, which in general scale poorly on multicore computers due to bandwidth limitations. However, with the task parallel implementation described here we achieve 60–100% of theoretical speedup within a shared memory node, and 80–100% of linear speedup across nodes. We present results for global shallow water benchmark problems with a 30 km resolution. "

It uses the fact that multiple input, single output, single hidden layer feedforward networks with a linear output layer with no bias are capable of arbitrarily well approximating arbitrary functions and its derivatives, which is proven by a number of authors and well known in literature. Knowledge about the pde and its boundary and/or initial conditions is incorporated into the structures and the training sets of several neural networks. In this way we obtain networks of which some are specifically structured. To find the solution of the pde and its boundary and/or initial conditions we have to train all obtained networks simultaneously. Therefore we use an evolutionary algorithm to train the networks. We demonstrate the working of our method by applying it to two problems.",

  abstract = 	 {Parameter inference in mechanistic models based on systems of coupled differential equations is a topical yet computationally challenging problem, due to the need to follow each parameter adaptation with a numerical integration of the differential equations. Techniques based on gradient matching, which aim to minimize the discrepancy between the slope of a data interpolant and the derivatives predicted from the differential equations, offer a computationally appealing shortcut to the inference  problem. The present paper discusses a method based on nonparametric Bayesian statistics with Gaussian processes due to Calderhead et al. (2008), and shows how inference in this model can be substantially improved by consistently sampling from the joint distribution of the ODE parameters and GP hyperparameters. We demonstrate the efficiency of our adaptive gradient matching technique on three benchmark systems, and perform a detailed comparison with the method in Calderhead et al. (2008) and the explicit ODE integration approach, both in terms of parameter inference accuracy and in terms of computational efficiency.}

abstract = {
We formulate the problem of solving stochastic linear operator equations in a Bayesian Gaussian process (GP) framework. The solution is obtained in the spirit of a collocation method based on noisy evaluations of the target function at randomly drawn or deliberately chosen points. Prior knowledge about the solution is encoded in terms of the covariance kernel of the GP. As in GP regression, analytical expressions for the mean and variance of the estimated target function are obtained from which the solution to the operator equation follows by a manipulation of the kernel. Linear initial and boundary value constraints can be enforced by embedding the non-parametric model in a form that automatically satisfies the boundary conditions. The method is illustrated on a noisy linear first-order ordinary differential equation with initial condition and on a noisy second-order partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
